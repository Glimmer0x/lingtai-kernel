"""Production adapters translating the live Agent body into host plugin ports.

`lingtai.kernel.tool_plugin` owns the Ports; this module is the one production
Adapter set that satisfies them for a running ``BaseAgent``, and it lives
outside the kernel package so the dependency still points inward
(``Adapter -> Port <- Core``, root ``CONTRACT.md`` rules 2-3).

Each adapter is constructed from one narrow callable — a bound method of the
agent, or a single-expression read closure — never from the agent object. That
is a real constraint on this file rather than a security boundary: an adapter
here cannot reach a second Agent API by accident, because it never holds the
Agent. Deep reachability through a bound method's ``__self__`` or a closure
cell is not prevented and is not claimed to be — the promise the contract makes
is about the declared argument surface handed to a plugin.

Which declarations get registered, and when, stays in the Composition Root
(``src/lingtai/agent.py`` and the capability ``setup()`` it drives). This module
only builds the ports.

    One declaration per call is the shipped shape today (one family recuts at a
